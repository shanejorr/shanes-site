<p>The veil of darkness test attempts to uncover racial differences in traffic stop rates. The test, like all tests, has its own weaknesses and should only be seen as additional evidence. It can provide evidence for or against bias in police stops, but should never be taken as the final say.</p>
<p>This post’s purpose is to lay out an example of the veil of darkness test within a Bayesian framework using R. It’s not to prove or disprove discrimination using the test. I leave that delicate task to people more proficient than myself.</p>
<div id="what-is-the-veil-of-darkness-test" class="section level2">
<h2>What is the veil of darkness test?</h2>
<p>Here’s how <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0858-1">a group of scholars</a> explained the test:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[The] method starts from the idea that officers who engage in racial profiling are less able to identify a driver’s race after dark than during the day. As a result, if officers are discriminating against black drivers—all else being equal—one would expect black drivers to comprise a smaller share of stopped drivers at night, when a veil-of-darkness masks their race. To account for patterns of driving and police deployment that may vary throughout the day, the test leverages the fact that the sun sets at different times during the year.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s say it’s dark at 7 p.m. for a third of the year, light for a third of the year, and kind-of dark for a third of the year. We want to compare the percentage of all drivers pulled over who are Black and when it’s light at 7 p.m. against the percentage of all drivers are pulled over who are Black when it’s dark at 7 p.m. If a larger percentage are pulled over when it’s light we have some evidence of racial bias.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, let’s get started.</p>

<h2>Comparing Stops Per 100 Residents Among Racial Groups</h2>
<p>Prior to modeling racial bias with the veil of darkness test, let’s take a look at the data. The traffic stop data set comes from <a href="https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/">the Stanford Open Policing Project</a> and is the same data used in <a href="https://www.shaneorr.io/post/exploratory-analysis-of-north-carolina-traffic-stop-data/">the last post</a>.</p>

<h4>Load data</h4>
<p>I placed copies of the Stanford Open Policing Project into a Digital Ocean Space. I’m pulling from this Space.</p>

<p>One way to show racial differences in traffic stops is to compare stops per 100 residents between racial groups. The figure below shows this comparison for all North Carolina counties. The top plot compares Black and White drivers, while the bottom plot highlights Latinx and White drivers. Each point is a county. The diagonal line is the trend we would expect if drivers of different races had the same number of stops per 100 residents.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a lot of data cleaning first to create a data set with county populations and aggregate number of traffic stops per county.</p>

<p>For almost all counties in North Carolina, Black drivers are stopped at a higher rate per 100 residents than White drivers. This is shown by almost all of the points lying above the diagonal line for the Black / White comparison chart. The Latinx and White rates, however, are similar as shown by the dots in the Latinx / White graph falling along the diagonal line.</p>
<p>Of course, ending our analysis here is unwarranted. First, this does not account for how often different racial groups drive. It’s comparing stops per 100 residents, not stops per 100 miles driven. Second, we have not accounted for differences in policing patterns. In general, police patrol Black neighborhoods more frequently than White neighborhoods. Therefore, the greater police presence could account for the differences in stops per 100 residents.</p>
<p>Although, it’s no vindication of police to explain away the differences in stops per 100 residents by saying that their neighborhoods are more heavily patrolled. This simply kicks the bias up a step to the level of the deployment of policing assets. Finally, drivers within different racial groups may just drive differently.</p>

<div id="the-veil-of-darkness-test-in-north-carolina" class="section level2">
<h2>The Veil of Darkness Test in North Carolina</h2>
<div id="the-model" class="section level3">
<h3>The model</h3>
<p>We’ll now apply the veil of darkness test with a Bayesian logistic regression model. We’ll use the model to predict a driver’s race and then compare the probability that the driver is Black at a given time when it is dark outside to the probability at the same time when it is daylight. The data set includes all stops in North Carolina’s 40 largest counties between 2009 and 2013. For modeling, we are only using times of the day that experience both daylight and darkness. This is from 5:24 P.M. to 8:21 P.M.</p>
<p>The model’s predictors are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time of day (minute) that the stop occurred, with a natural spline.</li>
<li>Driver’s age, with a natural spline.</li>
<li>Driver’s sex</li>
<li>Year as a categorical variable (2009- 2013).</li>
<li>Whether it is dark outside at the time of the stop as a categorical.</li>
<li>County as a fixed effect (We should ideally use county within a hierarchical model, but the hierarchical model took too long to run and I gave up!)</li>
<li>Interaction term between whether it is dark and county. The interaction term is needed because we want to break the results down by county.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a regularization tool, all coefficients containing counties - whether the interaction term with counties or just counties alone - have Student T priors with a scale of 1. That said, we have so much data that priors make little difference.</p>
<p>The outcome variable is the driver’s race. Since logistic regression models require the outcome to be discrete (take one of two values), I filtered the data to only include Black and White drivers.</p>
<div id="creating-models-data-set" class="section level4">
<h4>Creating model’s data set</h4>
<p>The veil of darkness test requires a lot of data cleaning and pre-processing. Most of the work centers on incorporating sunset and dusk times for each day and county, and then figuring out how many minutes after or before dusk a stopped occurred.</p>
<p>The proceeding code block starts by importing each county’s shape file using the <code>tigris</code> package. Each county’s centroid - it’s center in latitude and longitude - is then calculated using the shape file. We then use the <code>suncalc</code> package to calculate the time of sunset and dusk for each county centroid on each day of the year.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># create dataset for veil of darkness test -----------------------

# get centroid of every county
# we will use this centroid to figure out the county&#39;s time of sunset and dusk for each day

# get county shapefiles and centroids
nc_counties &lt;- counties(state = &#39;NC&#39;, cb = T)

# find centroid of each county by using it&#39;s boundaries

# extend dataset to include a county row for each day
# neede because function to calcualte sunset requires date column in dataframe

most_pop_counties &lt;- county_pop %&gt;%
 arrange(desc(value)) %&gt;%
 head(40) %&gt;%
 .[[1]]</code></pre>

<h3>The results</h3>
<p>The next plot highlights the applicable model results. It’s the posterior distribution for each county of the percentage point difference between darkness and daylight in the percent of drivers who get stopped that are Black. The predictions assume a 20 year old male driver who is pulled over at 7 p.m. Let’s use an example to better understand.</p>
<p>Let’s say that at 7 p.m. during the time of year when it is dark out the percentage breakdown of those being stopped is as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Race</th>
<th>Percentage breakdown</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Black</td>
<td>49%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>White</td>
<td>51%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Conversely, at 7 p.m. when it is light the percentage breakdown changes as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Race</th>
<th>Percentage breakdown</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Black</td>
<td>45%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>White</td>
<td>55%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The difference in the probability that a driver being pulled over is Black between when it is dark outside and when it is light at 7 p.m.: 49% - 45% = <strong>4 percentage points</strong></p>
<p>In this case, there is evidence of discrimination since Black drivers make up a higher percentage of drivers pulled over when it is dark compared to when it is light outside, keeping the time of day constant.</p>
<p>The values in the plot have the same meaning: positive numbers imply that Black drivers are pulled over more at night. The lines at the ends of the distributions represent 95% credible intervals.</p>
<div id="create-posterior-distribution-of-differences" class="section level4">
<h4>Create posterior distribution of differences</h4>
<p>The block below takes the posterior distributions in each county of predictions that a driver is Black when it is dark outside at 7 P.M. and subtracts it from the county posterior distributions of the same probability when it is light outside at 7 P.M. The resulting posterior distribution is what we will plot.</p>

<p>Overall, the results paint a mixed picture. Three counties have 95% credible intervals entirely above zero, while five counties have intervals below zero. These results, which don’t show any trends overall, raise worries about multiple comparison problems. After all, we are looking at 40 counties. It’s not crazy to think that one or two will have large values by chance. Sure, we have a lot of data and we put regularizing priors on the county coefficients; but the worry still lingers.</p>
<p>We can overlay all the posterior distributions to get a picture of the distribution of distributions. The following figure does this. The county-level distributions form a symmetrical, bell-shaped, distribution centered on zero. But, the two counties to the left, Craven and Gaston, separate themselves from the pack a bit.</p>

<p>Taking this all together, I’m hesitant to claim that the veil of darkness tests provides strong evidence of discrimination. At most, it could present evidence for the three counties with 95% credible intervals above zero. Plus, the strength of the evidence depends, in part, on the strength of the veil of darkness test as a tool. Let’s turn to the test’s limitations now.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="limitations-of-the-veil-of-darkness-test" class="section level2">
<h2>Limitations of the veil of darkness test</h2>
<p>The veil of darkness test, like all tests, has its limits. The first is the test’s scope. It’s not trying to discern bias writ-large, but a narrow type of bias: bias when police officers make the quick decision to pull someone over. But, there are multiple entry points of bias with law enforcement. As noted earlier, there might be racial bias is the deployment of law enforcement assets. This bias could feed into disparities in traffic stops without being picked up by the veil of darkness test.</p>
<p>But, the scope is even smaller than this. It only examines police officer bias in a small roughly three hour period when it’s daytime part of the year and nighttime part of the year. Additionally, many streets contain artificial lighting. The veil of darkness test assumes that officers do not know the race of the driver they are pulling over at night. Often, however, this isn’t true.</p>
<p>That said, the test is evidence. Not conclusive evidence, but a data point; part of a larger picture. Conclusively claiming discrimination, or lack thereof, requires more than one study, test, or blog-post. However, each study and test paints part of the picture.</p>
