<p>Evaluating the effectiveness of law schools is challenging for two reasons. The first hurdle lies in defining effectiveness. What does it mean for one law school to provide a better legal education than other schools? Generally, this centers on producing effective lawyers, although such a definition simply punts the definition of effectiveness up a level. Regardless, you cannot be an effective lawyer without actually becoming a licensed attorney. And to do this, you have to pass the bar exam. Thus, let’s make ‘preparing students to pass the bar exam’ one measure of law school effectiveness.</p>
<p>Now for the second hurdle. How do we measure whether a school effectively prepares students for the bar exam? This question is causal in nature, as can be seen from a hypothetical. Let’s take a student deciding on which law school to attend. She knows she is going to take the 2023 North Carolina bar exam. In evaluating law school effectiveness, we want to know her probability of bar passage in NC, based solely on her pre-law school characteristics, given various law schools. These differences in probabilities between law schools shed light on each law school’s effectiveness in preparing students for the bar exam.</p>
<p>Here is my attempt to answer this question. I lay out the problems with my approach at the end, but the bottom line is that I’m not convinced by my own post that it’s possible to answer this question with current data sources. But, I’ll let readers be the final judge.</p>
<div id="overview-of-method" class="section level2">
<h2>Overview of Method</h2>
<p>As already stated, we want to know how well law schools prepare students for the bar exam. We’ll do this by predicting each school’s bar passage rate based on school-level bar passage predictors and then measure how well each school performs against its predicted passage rate. To account for student quality, we will incorporate the school’s median, 25th percentile, and 75th percentile undergraduate GPA and LSAT score of incoming students. This allows us to account for pre-law school factors that correlate with bar passage.</p>
<p>We’ll also account for first-year attrition. The reason is that schools typically flunk-out poor performing students and these students have a low probability of bar passage. Thus, the quickest way for a school to raise its bar passage rate is to kick out more low-performing students. By including attrition as a predictor we ensure that a school does not perform better than expectations simply because it flunks out more students.</p>
</div>
<div id="exploration-of-lsat-undergrad-gpa-and-attrition-as-predictors" class="section level2">
<h2>Exploration of LSAT, undergrad GPA, and attrition as predictors</h2>
<p>AccessLex Institute <a href="https://analytix.accesslex.org/DataSet">aggregates the data</a> law school’s submit to the American Bar Association. We’ll use this data to find each school’s yearly median, 25th percentile, and 75th percentile undergraduate GPA and LSAT score of incoming students, attrition rate, and bar passage rate by state and year. Prior to modeling, however, we’ll examine the individual relationships between the predictors and bar passage. This will provide us initial confirmation that we should at least test them in models.</p>
<p>Years in this analysis represent the year students took the bar exam. For admissions factors such as median undergrad GPA and LSAT this means that the years represent the median values for students who entered law school school three years prior to the stated year.</p>
<div id="relationship-between-bar-passage-and-both-undergraduate-gpa-and-lsat-scores" class="section level3">
<h3>Relationship between bar passage and both undergraduate GPA and LSAT scores</h3>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:plotAdmisPredictors">1</a> shows the relationship between both median undergrad GPA (top plot) and median LSAT score (bottom plot) and bar passage. Each reveal a positive relationship between the admissions factor and bar passage.</p>

<div id="correlation-between-median-lsat-and-median-undergrad-gpa" class="section level3">
<h3>Correlation between median LSAT and median undergrad GPA</h3>
<p>We’ll next look at the correlation between median undergrad GPA and median LSAT. Our prior is that these two predictors are highly correlated, as more elite schools have higher median undergrad GPAs and LSAT scores. This could cause colinearity problems within our models. We’re not worried about colinearity wrecking havoc on our regression coefficients, as we’re focused on predictions and not the coefficient values. But, colinearity can also widen the uncertainty of predictions. This is our worry.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:plotAdmisPredictors">1</a> reveals that median undergrad GPA and median LSAT are highly correlated. Both predictors are standardized to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. Standardizing them allows us to compare their linear relationship - the blue line - with a prefect correlation represented by a line with a slope of 1 - the red dashed line. The plot shows an extremely strong relationship between median undergrad GPA and median LSAT. The linear relationship is only slightly flatter than the perfect relationship (red dashed line). We’ll address colinearity in the modeling section.</p>

<h3>Association between 1L attrition and both median LSAT and median undergrad GPA</h3>
<p>Let’s also look at the association between first year (1L) attrition and both median undergrad GPA and median LSAT. Our expectation, based on prior knowledge, is that schools with lower median undergrad GPA and LSAT scores will also have higher attrition. Figure <a href="#fig:plotAttritAdmis">3</a> confirms this prior. But, the relationship is not strong enough to cause colinearity issues.</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:plotAttritAdmis"></span>

<div id="association-between-1l-attrition-and-bar-passage" class="section level3">
<h3>Association between 1L attrition and bar passage</h3>
<p>Finally, figure <a href="#fig:plotAttritPassage">4</a> highlights the association between attrition and bar passage. Not surprisingly, it’s negative: schools with higher attrition rates have lower bar passage rates. This finding is not unexpected because we saw from figure <a href="#fig:plotAdmisPredictors">1</a> that higher median undergrad GPA and LSAT scores correlate with higher bar passage rates and <a href="#fig:plotAttritAdmis">3</a> showed us that lower median undergrad GPA and LSAT scores are associated with higher attrition rates. Putting both findings together, we assume that higher attrition rates correlate with lower bar passage rates.</p>

<h2>Difference between predicted and actual bar passage</h2>
<div id="models-with-admissions-factors-as-predictors" class="section level3">
<h3>Models with admissions factors as predictors</h3>
<p>We now turn to the heart of this post. We’ll predict each school’s bar passage rate and see how actual rates stack up against predictions. But, we need a good model to do this. We know our potential predictors: median, 25th percentile, and 75th percentile undergraduate GPA and LSAT score, and first year attrition. But, we don’t know the functional form of the model that provides the best predictions. Do we need them all or only a couple of them?</p>
<p>We will use two steps to search for the best model. First, we will conduct model comparison and validation on five different models that only include the undergrad GPA and LSAT predictors, along with year and state. Then, we will take this model and compare it against models with attrition as an additional predictor. We’ll compare the models by testing their predictions out of sample using leave-one-out cross validation (LOO). Posterior prediction checks will also be used to ensure the fit is reasonable.</p>
<p>All models will be Bayesian hierarchical logistic regressions. The response is a school’s bar passage rate for a given state and year, with the model weighted by the number of takers. All models have the same group-level predictors: state and year. They only differ in their school-level predictors, which are as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><em>Linear:</em> median undergraduate GPA and median LSAT score for the given graduating class year.</p></li>
<li><p><em>PCA:</em> Figure <a href="#fig:plotAdmisPredictors">1</a> showed that median undergraduate GPA and median LSAT score are highly correlated, raising fears of colinearity. The 25th, median, and 75th percentiles of each metric are also highly correlated with themselves (the 25th percentile undergrad GPA is correlated with the median undergrad GPA). But, we do not want to throw away the percentile information. We’ll use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the six highly correlated percentile variables into a smaller number of uncorrelated ones, while maintaining as much of the information in the variables as possible. The table below shows that the first two principal components contain 98% of the variance in the six variables. By only using these two principal components as predictors, we get 98% of the variance in the six undergrad GPA and LSAT percentile variables with only two uncorrelated variables.</p></li>

<h3>Poserior predictive checks of admissions factors models</h3>
<p>Posterior predictive checks (PPC) simulate y values - bar passage rates - from the models. Our checks simulate 200 distributions of bar passage rates and we can then compare these distributions to the actual distribution of rates. Ideally, they will align.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:ppcPlots">5</a> shows the PPC plots. All models have the same problem: they overpredict at the 75% to 90% bar passage rates and underpredict at the tails. This is shown by the dark line (actual distribution) being lower than the light lines (simulated distributions) at the 75% to 90% range and higher than the light lines outside this point. The takeaway from the misfit models is that there will be too many predictions in the 75% to 90% range and not enough at each tail.</p>
<p>Although not ideal, this misfit isn’t fatal. Plus, adding attrition hopefully improves fit. So, let’s take the PCA spline model and work in attrition.</p>

<div id="add-attrition-as-a-predictor" class="section level3">
<h3>Add attrition as a predictor</h3>
<p>We’ll incorporate attrition using the natural logarithm of attrition. The natural logarithm is used because attrition rates have a right skew: most schools have attrition rates between 0% and 15%, but some schools have rates greater than 30%. Using the natural logarithm removes much of the right skew and makes the distribution more symmetrical.</p>
<p>We’ll create two different models with attrition. Each an extensions of the PCA spline model. The first adds the natural logarithm of attrition, centered, as an individual predictor. The second also includes the natural logarithm of attrition, but wraps it in a spline to model non-linearity.</p>
<p>The table below compares each model based on the ELPD using leave-one-out cross validation. We see little different between the two models with attrition added, but these two models are better than the PCA spline model without attrition.</p>

<p>Moving on to our next model check, the plot of posterior predictive checks in figure <a href="#fig:ppcPlots2">6</a> shows that the models with attrition have the same problem we encountered in figure <a href="#fig:ppcPlots">5</a>. More predicted pass rates fall between 70% and 90% than would be expected given the distribution of actual bar passage rates.</p>
<p>Despite the non-ideal fit, the PCA spline model without attrition will be used to predict bar passage rates of schools. This model performs almost identically to the PCA spline model with attrition added as a spline, but is simpler. All things equal, we’ll opt for the simpler.</p>

<h2>Comparing actual and predicted bar passage rates for all US law schools</h2>
<p>With technicalities behind use, let’s get to the results. Figure <a href="#fig:plotPredictions">7</a> compares each law school’s predicted and actual bar passage rates from 2014 to 2019. The left plot shows the 95% credible intervals for each school’s predicted bar passage rate (in red) and its actual rate (blue). The right plot, meanwhile, displays the 95% credible interval for each school’s residual. The residual is the actual rate minus the predicted rate. Finally, the percentages on the right represent the probability that the school’s actual rate is higher than its predicted rate. Stated differently, it’s the probability that the residual is positive.</p>

<div id="three-problems-with-the-methodology" class="section level2">
<h2>Three problems with the methodology</h2>
<p>What do we make of the plots? For starters, simply ranking each school by its residual is ill-advised for three reasons.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Schools have a lot of uncertainty in their residuals. A school’s ranking will be it’s true residual plus uncertainty in the residuals; the dreaded error terms in models. The higher this uncertainty is, the more that the ranking for specific schools will simply reflect randomness. Here, the uncertainty is large enough to where rankings will reflect more randomness than we are comfortable with. We illustrate this in figure <a href="#fig:plotPredictions">7</a>. It shows the University of Kentucky’s residual ranking among all 201 law schools based on 500 simulations of the model. The most likely ranking is 84 and the 90% credible interval stretches from 28 to NA. This range is too wide to be helpful.</li>

<h2>Comparing similair schools</h2>
<p>Taking reasons two and three together, a better approach might be to compare similar schools. For example, with might compare schools with similar admissions factors and where the majority of bar takers are from the same state. To highlight this method, we’ll compare three North Carolina schools with similar admissions factors: Campbell University, Elon University, and North Carolina Central University.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:plotResidCompare">9</a> shows the comparison’s results. It’s the difference between each school in their difference of residuals, only incorporating North Carolina bar exam results. To account for uncertainty, the entire probability distribution is shown for these differences.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works. Let’s say that Campbell’s actual NC bar passage rate is 70% and their predicted rate is 60%, for a difference of 10 percentage points. Elon’s actual NC rate and predicted rate are both 60%, for a difference of 0. In this situation, Campbell’s residual - difference between actual and predicted bar passage rate - is 10 percentage points higher than Elon’s (10 - 0).</p>

<p>OK, so this <em>might</em> be useful. But, I’m still not comfortable with it due to the problems previously mentioned. The best course of action is to scrap the whole enterprise. But, in the spirit of not letting a good analysis go to waste, I figured I would post it here for posterity.</p>

<h2>Addendum: the final rankings that have little value</h2>
<p>If you ignored this post’s advice and want to know the actual modeled ranking, here they are. Again, you shouldn’t make much of them; I’m certainly not. And you especially shouldn’t make much of them once you see the wide 90% credible intervals. Also, going back to problem two mentioned above, notice that almost all of the top ranking schools have low LSAT / GPA combinations and low bar passage rates.</p>
